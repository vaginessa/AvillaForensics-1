# Avilla-Forensics
Esta es una extensión del proyecto original de [Avilla Forensics](https://github.com/AvillaDaniel/AvillaForensics).

# Description

This repository contains the original link to the source code and resources associated with the Avilla Forensics project, originally developed by Daniel Avilla. Avilla Forensics is a tool designed to assist in digital forensic analysis on mobile devices, providing a series of automated utilities for data management and analysis.

Some of the most outstanding features of Avilla Forensics is its ability to mount forensic images in a virtual machine, incorporated in the same tool; connect several Android & Iphone devices and analyze them at the same time; process and analyze digital evidence seized in IPED; as well as the downgrading technique known as APK Downgrade, applicable in Android versions higher than 11 or 12... and more.

Avilla Forensics also stands out for its ease of use and user-friendly structure. Users can easily navigate through the software's intuitive interface and access tools and features quickly and efficiently.

In Avilla Forensics version 3.7, numerous enhancements and new functionalities for mobile data extraction and analysis have been implemented. This update introduced an integrity system that generates AES-256 encrypted logs (.avilla), which contain hashes of the collected files. In addition to encryption, the .avilla file has an HMAC signature, which creates a second layer of protection for file integrity.

Version 3.7 significantly enhances data extraction and analysis capabilities, offering new integrity functionality and advanced tools for managing backups and extracting data from applications. These enhancements make the tool even more robust and effective for forensic investigations.

# Avilla Forensics 3.7.1 - Modified

## List of changes in version 3.7.1, offered by UCAPEM Academy:

* **Transcription of OPUS audio files:** The official version, only allows the transcription of OPUS audios in Brazilian Portuguese language, so we have added the Spanish language for the transcription of these audio files.
* Transcription of MP3, OPUS, WAV, WMA audio files in IPED:** The indexing of files through IPED, brings by default the transcription of audio files in Brazilian Portuguese, so we have also added the Spanish language for the transcription of these audio files, through the IPED indexer.
